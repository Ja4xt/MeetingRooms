## 2. Objectives

The goal of the project is to develop a user-friendly application for reserving meeting rooms. The application will allow users to make reservations in hourly blocks, and they can reserve multiple blocks at once. Reservation details will include the user's name, contact information, and a description of the reservation.

The project is coded in C#, and the database is implemented using SQL Server Express. The software is designed to serve as a management tool for companies with multiple meeting rooms, providing a clear reservation system to optimize room usage and avoid misunderstandings.
