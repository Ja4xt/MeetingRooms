# Meeting Room Reservation App Documentation

## 1. Introduction

We chose the project of a Meeting Room Reservation System because it is an essential tool for various industries and workplaces to streamline everyday activities. Having a fast and clear way to reserve different rooms based on needs and groups makes organizing meetings and events more efficient.

The application is an easy-to-use Windows application written in C#. It can be installed on multiple devices, allowing users to make reservations from their workstations. The visual concept of the user interface includes:

## 2. Objectives

The goal of the project is to develop a user-friendly application for reserving meeting rooms. The application will allow users to make reservations in hourly blocks, and they can reserve multiple blocks at once. Reservation details will include the user's name, contact information, and a description of the reservation.

The project is coded in C#, and the database is implemented using SQL Server Express. The software is designed to serve as a management tool for companies with multiple meeting rooms, providing a clear reservation system to optimize room usage and avoid misunderstandings.
